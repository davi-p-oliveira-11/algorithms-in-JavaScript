/*
34) The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a value calculated based on a person's height and weight. 
According to the BMI value, we can classify the individual within certain ranges.

below 18.5: Underweight
between 18.5 and 25: Ideal weight
between 25 and 30: Overweight
between 30 and 40: Obesity
above 40: Morbid obesity
Note: BMI is calculated by the expression weight/heightÂ² (weight divided by the square of height)
